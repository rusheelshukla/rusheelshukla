### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm working as a data scientist for last four years with retail businesses.
I love using algorithms and data to solve their operational issues using machine learning.
I have a background in computer science and industrial engineering.
I have been focussed on Python and R, but also believe technology used is just a means to the end.
